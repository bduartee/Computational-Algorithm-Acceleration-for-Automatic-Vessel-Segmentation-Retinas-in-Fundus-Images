# Computational-Algorithm-Acceleration-for-Automatic-Vessel-Segmentation-Retinas-in-Fundus-Images


An algorithm in C++ to increase the processing speed of certain critical functions of a retinal vessel segmentation program developed in Python. The algorithm developed in C++ is compiled using the Linux operating system installed in a virtual box. For this, in addition to the code in C++ and Python, an interface was built in Cython, thus allowing its import into the Jupyter notebook.

This projects uses the DRIVE dataset (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1282003).
